# homebrew-void
"Excuse the 'void'—a Homebrew tap, void of wasted space, and full of things you never knew you needed-existing in the void."
##### 

```
brew tap inspirationull/homebrew-void
```
#### To improve your shell experience instantly, run
```
brew install whereall bettersed
```
##### Bettersed is an infinitely friendlier version of sed. Whereall is an actual 'where'-like executable, so you can pipe it into other commands or use with alternative shells
